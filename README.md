# inOREout-gazepoint-AOI-tracking
This script was written to track via Gazepoint eye tracking data whether participants were looking within any AOI (faces). A tool was developed to manually track AOI frame by frame. Then scripts were written to compressed eye tracking data and establish how often each participant was looking at an AOI for each frame.
